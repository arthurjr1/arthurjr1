### An example of my skills

mx %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 5:15, # try different specs to see what can go wrong
    names_to = 'Year', # new var recording col names
    names_transform = list(Year = as.integer),
    values_to = 'CO2emit'  # new var recording the data
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = CO2emit)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```
